# Homeworks and projects

These are my homeworks and projects while I was getting my Master's Degree in Computational Data Science in the University of Bolzano, Italy. The 'ir' directory stands for the "Information Retrieval" course and "ml" is for "Machine Learning" course. I have worked with Python; mainly using the libraries "nltk" and "pandas".
